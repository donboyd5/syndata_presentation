// Reduce the 2013 33% rate by 1% point to 32% (or by some different amount).
// Don Boyd
//
// This is intended to be roughly comparable to Dan Feenberg's
// revenue score item called _rt5, which reduced the 2011 33% rate
// by 1% point. I use 2013, which is the earliest year for which 
// Tax-Calculator calculates taxes.

// The synthpop5_all synthetic file did poorly on _rt5 by Dan's
// measure, which was the $ change in the synth file as a % of
// the $ change in the puf -- he found that the revenue score of the
// synthfile, so measured, was too high by about 10% (regardless of
// whether adjusted synthesized weights were used, or weights constructed
// from scratch).
//
// The change below should capture an approximately similar group of
// taxpayers to what Dan did. For example, the 2011 33% rate applied to 
// taxable income of married joint taxpayers from ~ $212-379k, and 
// in 2013 it applied to marrieds with TI of $223-398k
// (according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#Marginal_tax_rates_since_2008).
